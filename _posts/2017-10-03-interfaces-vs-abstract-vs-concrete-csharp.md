## Concrete vs Abstract vs Interface

Concrete
It ddoestn enforces us to override method in child class
can contain implementations

Abstract
must override abstract methods
can contain implentation code
You san only derive from single base class
We can control access (public private protected and internal)
Can contain enithing you can put into normal class (fields, propertesm constructors, destructiors, methods, events, indexers)

Interface
must provicde impolementations for all the methods
Cant contain impolementation code, only definitions
You can implenent multiple interfaces (sagregation)
All members are automatically public (contract terms)
Can contain only Properties, Methods, Events and Indexers
